            We believe that just because you’re short on time doesn’t mean you should settle for takeout or frozen meals
            every night. Our recipes use everyday ingredients you probably already have at home. Many of them take 30
            minutes or less to make. Some are even ready in 15 minutes! From quick pastas and easy stir-fries to one-pan
            dinners and no-cook lunches, there’s something here for everyone. We also include tips to help you save time
            while cooking, like how to prep ingredients ahead or how to cook smarter with fewer dishes.
